          Motion has been detected, compare and very briefly describe what you see
          in the following sequence of images from my driveway camera number 1.
          What do you think caused the motion alarm? Do not describe stationary objects or
          buildings. If you see no obvious causes of motion, reply with "no".
          Your message needs to be short enough to fit in a phone notification.
